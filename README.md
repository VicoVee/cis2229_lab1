# CIS2229 Lab 1 Example Site
Welcome to Lab 1 for CIS2229! This lab is expected to take TWO lab sessions to complete (2 weeks). Through this lab, you will learn the basics on web development and remote hosting. 

Use this code as an example to your submission.
The rubric is located at the end of the page manual as well as in the Canvas page. 

Addition resources on HTML and CSS is located in the Canvas page as well. 

## Additional Notes
The files are named to conveniently reflect the lab manual; however, it can be confusing and is a pretty bad practice.
When changing the files name, don't forget to change them as well in the code when referenced. 
The first page that launches from your site is usually called the index.html file. For the lab, I redirected the 
DirectoryIndex to page1.html using .htaccess. If you want to change the first page that loads, use .htaccess and replace
the file name to yours.
